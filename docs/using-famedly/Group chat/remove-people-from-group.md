## Remove people from a group

Famedly organises conversations between several people in groups. Groups provide order and clarity for work. Create topic-based groups or groups for teams to encourage collaboration. If a person no longer needs to be part of a group, the person can be removed. Administrators of a group can remove people from the group.

If you remove a person from a group, that person can no longer participate in the communication, but still has access to old messages within the group.

# Group chat **tips and best practices**

- Make sure that the group chats you [create](https://www.notion.so/Create-a-group-chat-Gruppenchat-erstellen-f46d9e68dbab41d98cd5090d3f084ff2) or maintain have a clear [topic and description](https://www.notion.so/Set-a-group-subject-or-description-Gruppenbetreff-oder-Beschreibung-bearbeiten-8ac0fd2a5b734eb18b8b5ce1671e1a11) so that people understand what they’re used for.
- Make your group chats unique by [setting up a profile picture for your group chat](https://www.notion.so/Set-or-change-group-picture-Gruppenbild-festlegen-oder-ndern-67ac760d50454c1882748be5157496ad).
- [Archive group chats](https://www.notion.so/Delete-a-group-Gruppe-l-schen-aec15bdf8150471198cb332203dee3cf) when they’re no longer needed.

# **Add people to a group**

Groups are the best way to¬†keep conversations about various projects, topics or teams organised in Famedly. Add people to groups to bring the right people and information together in one place.
You can add an unlimited number of people to a group. The larger the groups become, the more confusing the collaboration can become. We therefore recommend consciously considering which people are added.

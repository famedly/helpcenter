## Verify devices

Messages are encrypted for each device individually, so you should verify all your own devices to prove that it's not someone else who got hold of your credentials.

If you want to use the end-to-end encryption on every device you need to verify your devices. All messages are encrypted for each device separately. Therefore verification is necessary to ensure the right person is receiving the message.

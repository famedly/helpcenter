:::info

**How can I create a passphrase?**

If you have not yet created a chat backup and have not yet received a passphrase you can set one up the first time you log in to the web browser.

**When do I need the passphrase?**

You only need the passphrase if you are logged out on all devices and the verification between two devices is therefore not possible. In this case the passphrase must be entered so that all old messages are decrypted after login.

**What happens if I have lost the passphrase and am logged out on all devices? on all devices?**

If you have not kept your passphrase or can no longer find it, and you are also are logged out on all devices, you can only reset your account. Your contacts and groups remain, but previous message content can no longer be decrypted. 

:::

:::caution

With the passphrase, you have access to all your encrypted data and previous chat histories. You need this passphrase to recover your chat history if you have been
logged out on all devices.
The passphrase cannot be recovered if lost!

## Usage of Verification

You will get redirected to the verification page automatically in the login-flow, 
if at least one of the devices you want to use for verification is a mobile device.  
If you nevertheless get redirected to the number- or emoji-verification instead, 
please check if there is an update for one of your devices.

    <li>Accept the verification request by clicking on <b>Continue</b> in the <b>New verification request</b> dialog.</li>
    <li>If the other device is a mobile device, the screen on your web tab will display a QR code. If it's another web device, it will fallback to number verification.</li>
    <li>Scan the QR code displayed on your web browser with your mobile device. If both devices are in web browsers, compare the numbers and confirm them.</li>
    <li>If by some reason you are not able to scan the QR code, you can tap on <b>Compare numbers instead of QR-Code</b>.</li>
    <li>After scanning the QR code, you will be asked if it was really you who scanned the QR code on your already active device. Click on <b>Yes, it was me</b> to complete the verification.</li>

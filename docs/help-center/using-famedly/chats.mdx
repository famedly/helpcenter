### Add people to a group

Groups are the best way to keep conversations about various projects, topics or teams organised in Famedly. Add people to groups to bring the right people and information together in 
one place. You can add an unlimited number of people to a group. The larger the groups become, the more confusing the collaboration can become. We therefore recommend consciously 
considering which people are added.

### Remove people from a group

Famedly organises conversations between several people in groups. Groups provide order and clarity for work. Create topic-based groups or groups for teams to encourage collaboration. 
If a person no longer needs to be part of a group, the person can be removed. Administrators of a group can remove people from the group.

If you remove a person from a group, that person can no longer participate in the communication, but still has access to old messages within the group.

## External label

To ensure that no information is unintentionally shared with outside organisations, we have introduced an "external" label. If you invite people to chat rooms, or 
if chat rooms with external people already exist, they will be marked with the "External" label accordingly.

## Chat tips and best practices

- Make sure that the group chats you create or maintain have a clear topic and description so that people understand what they’re used for.
- Make your group chats unique by setting up a profile picture for your group chat
- Archive group chats when they’re no longer needed.

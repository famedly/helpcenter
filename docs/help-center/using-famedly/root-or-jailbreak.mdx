Famedly is committed to ensuring the security and integrity of its platform.
To maintain a safe and secure environment for all users, we strongly discourage the use of our app on
rooted or jailbroken devices. In this article, we will explain why you should avoid using Famedly on
such devices, the potential risks involved, and how Famedly protects its users.

### Why Shouldn't You Use Famedly on a Rooted or Jailbroken Device?

#### Security Risks:
Rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS) devices have had their default security measures bypassed,
allowing users to gain superuser privileges. While this can be beneficial for some, it also exposes
your device to greater security risks. Apps and services on such devices can access sensitive system
files and resources, potentially making it easier for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.

#### Increased Vulnerability:
A rooted or jailbroken device becomes more vulnerable to malware and unauthorized access. These devices
are more susceptible to various forms of attacks, including spyware, adware, and other malicious
software that can compromise your privacy and data.

#### Famedly's Warning and File Download Prevention:
To protect our users and maintain a secure environment, Famedly has implemented measures to detect
rooted or jailbroken devices. If you attempt to use our app on such a device, you will receive a
warning message notifying you that your device is not supported for security reasons. Additionally,
file downloads may be prevented to ensure your data remains secure.

#### What to Do If You Receive a Warning:
If you encounter a warning message when using Famedly on a rooted or jailbroken device, we strongly
recommend discontinuing its use. To continue using our app securely, you should consider using an
unaltered and up-to-date device.

#### Conclusion:
Famedly values the security and privacy of our users. We discourage the use of rooted or
jailbroken devices to ensure the safety and integrity of our platform. If you receive a warning
message while attempting to use Famedly on such a device, please take it seriously and consider
using an unaltered device for the best and safest experience. Your security and the security of
our community are of paramount importance to us.

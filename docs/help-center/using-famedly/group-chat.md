## Add people to a group

Groups are the best way to keep conversations about various projects, topics or teams organised in Famedly. Add people to groups to bring the right people and information together in one place. You can add an unlimited number of people to a group. The larger the groups become, the more confusing the collaboration can become. We therefore recommend consciously considering which people are added.

## Remove people from a group

Famedly organises conversations between several people in groups. Groups provide order and clarity for work. Create topic-based groups or groups for teams to encourage collaboration. If a person no longer needs to be part of a group, the person can be removed. Administrators of a group can remove people from the group.

If you remove a person from a group, that person can no longer participate in the communication, but still has access to old messages within the group.

## Record voice messages

### Record short voice messages

You can send voice messages from Famedly on your mobile device.
    
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile">
  <ol>
    <li>Open a chat.</li>
    <li>Speak your message while you hold down the <b>Microphone icon</b> in the bottom right corner.</li>
    <li>You can send the message by releasing the button or cancel it by sliding your finger to the left and release afterwards.</li>
  </ol>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Record long voice messages

If you want to record long messages, we recommend using the lock feature. This allows you to temporarily let go of the mobile device and even pause the recording and continue later as long as you leave the chat open.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile">
  <ol>
    <li>Open a chat.</li>
    <li>Press the <b>microphone icon</b> and start speaking your message.</li>
    <li>The text <b>Swipe to lock</b> will appear on the screen, along with a <b>lock</b> icon in the middle. Swipe your finger towards the <b>lock</b> icon and release your finger from the screen.</li>
    <li>A <b>pause</b> icon will now appear at the bottom center. If you want to pause the message, press it. To continue recording, press the <b>play</b> icon that will then appear.</li>
    <li>You can send the message by pressing the blue <b>arrow</b> button in the bottom right. To cancel, tap the <b>trash</b> icon.</li>
  </ol>

## Register eHBA card

You can register yourself on the TIM contact list by connecting your eHBA to your user account.  
Thereby you will be able to contact users from other organizations and be contacted by them, as long as they have registered an eHBA card in their account, too.  

:::note
You will need a mobile device with NFC to connect your eHBA to your user account.

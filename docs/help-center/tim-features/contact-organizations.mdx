## Contact users from other organizations

To be able to contact users from other organizations, you will either both need to [register your eHBA](./use-ehba#register-ehba-card)
or you will need to add each other to [approval list](./approval-list).  
You can now start a chat. If you need further help with this, you can follow the instructions to [start a direct chat](../using-famedly/chats#start-direct-chat).

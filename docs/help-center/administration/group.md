    <p>Famedly organises conversations between multiple people in group chats. Group chats provide order and clarity for work. Create topic-based group chats or group chats for teams to promote collaboration - group chats help you to better organise the daily work routine, distribute tasks, make decisions faster and thus advance the work. As Famedly relies on the Matrix Communication protocol it is posible to add people to Group Chats which uses Matrix Clients from other vendors.</p>

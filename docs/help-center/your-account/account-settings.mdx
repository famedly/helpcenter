## Screen lock

On mobile devices there is an option to lock the screen and unlock it either by entering a pin or by biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).  
A set screen lock will only apply on the device you activate it on and will disappear on logout. If you log in again, you will have to set it again but this also means that you can reset the screen lock by logging out if you forgot the pin. 

:::info

You might be required to set up a screen lock on mobile devices if your device does not have a system wide screen lock enabled or if your organization requires the usage of screen lock and will be prompted for that during the setup process.

## Privacy

Here you have options to choose if you want to share read receipts, typing indicators or your [online status](../using-famedly/chats#check-the-online-status-of-users) with others and if you want to share crash reports with Famedly to help us enhance the app. 
To protect your privacy, all those features are opt-in, so they are turned off by default.

### What are read receipts?

When the switch for sending read receipts is turned on, other user can see if you read a message. 
At the bottom right corner of every chat room just above the message input field you can see the profile pictures of the users who read the last message. If more than four users read the last message, only four profile pictures will be displayed there and the number of other users who read the message will be shown left to the profile pictures like e.g. <b>+3</b> if seven users read the last message. 
You can also enter the <b>Read by</b> page on the message settings to see who read a message. 
If you turn off the switch for sending read receipts, others will not see your profile picture at the bottom of the chat or in the <b>Read by</b> list. 

### What are typing indicators?

When the switch for sending typing indicators is turned on, this means that whenever you are typing and another person has the same chat room opened, the other person gets a notification above the message input field on the bottom left corner with your profile picture or initials saying <b>User is typing...</b> where ‚ÄúUser‚Äù stands for your own username. 
If you turn off sending typing indicators, this notification will not be shown for other users when you are typing. 

### What is your online status?

Other users that have an up-to-date version of Famedly will be able to see if you are online when you activate the toggle for sending the [online status](../using-famedly/chats#check-the-online-status-of-users).

## Screen lock

On mobile devices there is an option to lock the screen and unlock it either by entering a pin or by biometrics (e.g. fingerprint).  
A set screen lock will only apply on the device you activate it on and will disappear on logout. If you log in again, you will have to set it again but this also means that you can reset the screen lock by logging out if you forgot the pin. 

:::info

You might be required to set up a screen lock on mobile devices if your device doesn't have a system wide screen lock enabled or if your organization requires the usage of screen lock and will be prompted for that during the setup process.

:::

### Activate screen lock

    <li>Tap on <b>Lock screen</b> to enter screen lock settings.</li>
    <li>There tap on <b>Lock screen</b> again to activate the switch.</li>
    <li>Enter a pin code you want to use for screen lock.</li>
    <li>Confirm the pin code.</li>
    <li>You will now see further options on the <b>Lock screen</b> settings page.</li>
  </ol>

### Change pin code for screen lock

    <li>Enter your current pin code.</li>
    <li>Now enter the new pin code.</li>
    <li>Confirm the new pin code.</li>
  </ol>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use pin code for unlocking

After you closed or minimized the app you will be asked to authorize yourself with your screen lock pin when you open the app again. 
When you already activated screen lock and you open the app, you will be asked to enter your pin code. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile">
  <ol>
    <li>Tap on the number input field.</li>

    <li>If you forgot your pin code, please tap on the button <b>Logout</b> on the upper left corner,

  </ol>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use biometrics for screen lock

Instead of the pin code, you can unlock your device with biometrics like face id or fingerprint. The biometrics feature will use your devices default biometrics. You can still use your pin code and if you want to deactivate screen lock, you will still have to enter your pin code. If you forget your pin code, the only way to deactivate screen lock is to log out. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile">
  <ol>
    <li>Tap on <b>Use biometrics</b>.</li>
    <li>Identify with the biometrics you use on your device.</li>
    <li>If you now try to unlock the app, you will get prompted to use biometrics. You can cancel the dialog to use your pin code instead.</li>
  </ol>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Use auto lock for screen lock

If you want to make sure noone can read your messages because you might forget to put the app in background, you can choose different time spans for automated locking. 

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="mobile" label="Mobile">
  <ol>
    <li>Tap on <b>Auto lock</b>.</li>
    <li>Choose the time span for locking the screen from the list.</li>
    <li>The app will now lock itself after the time span you selected elapses with any inactivity.</li>
    <li>If you don't want to use the auto lock feature anymore, tap on <b>Auto lock</b> again and select “Deactivate” from the list.</li>
  </ol>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Connected devices

Here you will find all the devices connected to your account. You have the option to lock or remove devices here. Please note that by signing out of other devices, you will lose access to them. You will need to sign in again on those devices.

## Privacy

Here you have options to choose if you want to share read receipts, typing indicators or your online status with others and if you want to share crash reports with Famedly to help us enhance the app. 
To protect your privacy, all those features are opt-in, so they are turned off by default.

### What are read receipts?

When the switch for sending read receipts is turned on, other user can see if you read a message. 
At the bottom right corner of every chat room just above the message input field you can see the avatars of the users who read the last message. If more than four users read the last message, only four avatars will be displayed there and the number of other users who read the message will be shown left to the avatars like e.g. <b>+3</b> if seven users read the last message. 
You can also enter the <b>Read by</b> page on the message settings to see who read a message. 
If you turn off the switch for sending read receipts, others will not see your avatar at the bottom of the chat or in the <b>Read by</b> list. 

### What are typing indicators?

When the switch for sending typing indicators is turned on, this means that whenever you are typing and another person has the same chat room opened, the other person gets a notification above the message input field on the bottom left corner with your avatar or initials saying <b>User is typing...</b> where “User” stands for your own username. 
If you turn off sending typing indicators, this notification will not be shown for other users when you are typing. 

### What is your online status?

Currently on Famedly we do not show the online status of users but that might change in the future. 
Since matrix accounts can be used with other messengers, it is possible that a user you have a chat room with uses another client which does show the online status like e.g. Element. 
When the switch for sending online status is turned on, those users might see a green dot on your Avatar or other indicators for the online status when you have the app on foreground or a yellow dot for inactivity when you minimize the app. 
With the switch turned off, you will be shown as offline to any matrix messenger that can indicate the online status.
